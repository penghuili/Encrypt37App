# Encrypt37 - Encrypt and share

Encrypt37 has no tracking, it's open sourced, you can check the code [here](https://github.com/penghuili/Encrypt37).

**Encrypt37 has no server, everything happens on your device**: Your key pair, the encryption process, the encrypted texts and files.

All your texts and files are encrypted with your & your fiends's keypair's public via [react-native-fast-openpgp](https://github.com/jerson/react-native-fast-openpgp).
