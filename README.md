# Encrypt37 - Encrypt and share

End-to-end encrypt text and files, and get raw result.

**Open source, no tracking and free forever.**

**Encrypt37 has no server, everything happens on your device**: Your key pair, the encryption process, the encrypted texts and files.

You can safely upload the encrypted texts or files to wherever you want, making any cloud provider an encrypted storage.

**Everything is encrypted by the very well established algorithm PGP** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). The algorithm is used by [Proton](https://proton.me/), [Mailvelope](https://mailvelope.com/), [Encrypt.to](https://encrypt.to/) and many others.
